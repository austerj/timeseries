# timeseries

### Overview
**timeseries** is a Python package that provides a time series data structure. Time series objects can be instantiated from CSV files and provide basic computational capabilities, including filtering.

### Running unit tests

The library uses the [doctest](https://docs.python.org/3/library/doctest.html) and [unittest](https://docs.python.org/3/library/unittest.html) modules from the [Python Standard Library](https://docs.python.org/3/library/index.html) for testing. All tests can be executed by running the command
```sh
$ python -m unittest -v
```
in the parent directory of the repository.
